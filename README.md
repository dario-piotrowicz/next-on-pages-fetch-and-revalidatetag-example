# Next-on-pages basic fetch + `revalidateTag` example

This is a very basic example of data fetching + `revalidateTag` implemented in a Next.js application
and deployed to Cloudflare Pages via [next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/).

## To test the application locally

To locally test/run the application, start by installing the dependencies with:
```sh
$ npm i
```

then you can:
 - run the application using the Next.js dev server with:
    ```sh
    $ npm run dev
    ```
 - preview it using the [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler) cli tool with:
    ```sh
    $ npm run dev
    ```
 - deploy it with:
    ```sh
    $ npm run deploy
    ```
